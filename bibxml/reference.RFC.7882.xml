<abstract><t>This document describes various use cases for Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) and provides requirements such that protocol mechanisms allow for simplified detection of forwarding failures.</t><t>These use cases support S-BFD, which is a simplified mechanism for using BFD with a large proportion of negotiation aspects eliminated, accelerating the establishment of a BFD session.  The benefits of S-BFD include quick provisioning, as well as improved control and flexibility for network nodes initiating path monitoring.</t></abstract>
