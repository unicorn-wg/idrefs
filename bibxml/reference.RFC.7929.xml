<title>DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Bindings for OpenPGP</title>

<abstract><t>OpenPGP is a message format for email (and file) encryption that lacks a standardized lookup mechanism to securely obtain OpenPGP public keys.  DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is a method for publishing public keys in DNS.  This document specifies a DANE method for publishing and locating OpenPGP public keys in DNS for a specific email address using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS resource record.  Security is provided via Secure DNS, however the OPENPGPKEY record is not a replacement for verification of authenticity via the &quot;web of trust&quot; or manual verification.  The OPENPGPKEY record can be used to encrypt an email that would otherwise have to be sent unencrypted.</t></abstract>
