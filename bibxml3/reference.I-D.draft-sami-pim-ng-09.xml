<abstract><t>This document specifies protocol independent multicast- Next generation or simply called PIM-NG. PIM-NG uses the underlying unicast routing information, but unlike PIM-SM it doesn't necessarily need to build unidirectional shared trees rooted at a Rendezvous Point (RP) per group, due to the fact that the processes through which a source registers with the Rendezvous Point and a host finds the source of the multicast destination groups it needs are done in a whole new way and hence, the source of multicast group (G) is discovered faster. So at some points PIM-NG works faster than its predecessor. Also the new Domain concept, unique to PIM-NG, along the RPF check method used in PIM-NG specifications provides many features along a robust and flexible control and administration over multicast networks.</t></abstract>
