<abstract><t>In-band operation, administration and maintenance (OAM) records operational and telemetry information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between two points in the network.  In-band OAM is to complement current out-of-band OAM mechanisms based on ICMP or other types of probe packets.  This document outlines how in-band OAM data records can be transported in protocols such as NSH, Segment Routing, VXLAN-GPE, native IPv6 (via extension header), and IPv4. Transport options are currently investigated as part of an implementation study.  This document is intended to only serve informational purposes.</t></abstract>
