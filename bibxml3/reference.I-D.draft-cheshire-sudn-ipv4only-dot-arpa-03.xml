<abstract><t>The specification for how a client discovers its network's NAT64 prefix [RFC7050] defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but treats it as a non special name in the document's Domain Name Reservation Considerations section.  Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the name, as of July 2016 'ipv4only.arpa' still does not appear as one of the names with special properties that are recorded in the Special- Use Domain Names registry.  This document formally declares the actual special properties of the name, and adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping names.</t></abstract>
