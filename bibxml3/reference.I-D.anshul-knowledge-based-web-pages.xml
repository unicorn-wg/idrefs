<abstract><t>This document tries to address a problem of delivering redundant content of a dynamic web page to the same client over the Internet. The dynamic web page made up of two kind of data first one comes from external sources such as database or some text files etc which is dynamic in the nature and may change over the next request made from the same client, the second one is static in the nature such as formatting tag of html[3] which remain unchanged until the program of dynamic web page does not modified. Instead of sending the whole page at each subsequent request from the same client it is better to send the dynamic data and client can use the static data from the cache of previous response to format the dynamic data of current response.</t></abstract>
