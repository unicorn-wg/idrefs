<abstract><t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] protocol provides network related information to client applications so that clients may make informed decisions.  To that end, an ALTO Server provides Network and Cost Maps.  Using those maps, an ALTO Client can determine the costs between endpoints.  However, the ALTO protocol does not define a mechanism to allow an ALTO client to obtain updates to those maps, other than by periodically re-fetching them.  Because the maps may be large (potentially tens of megabytes), and because only parts of the maps may change frequently (especially Cost Maps), that can be extremely inefficient.  Therefore this document presents a mechanism to allow an ALTO Server to provide updates to ALTO Clients.  Updates can be both immediate, in that the server can send updates as soon as they are available, and incremental, in that if only a small section of a map changes, the server can send just the changes.</t></abstract>
