<abstract><t>The DNS relies upon caching to scale; however, the cache lookup generally requires an exact match.  This document specifies the use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource records to generate negative answers within a range.  This increases resilience to DoS attacks, increases performance / decreases latency, decreases resource utilization on both authoritative and recursive servers, and also increases privacy.  This document updates RFC4035 by allowing resolvers to generate negative answers based upon NSEC/NSEC3 records.  [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc.  They will be removed before publication.This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ietf- dnsop-nsec-aggressiveuse.
