<abstract><t>This document presents a high-level overview architecture for building data center network virtualization overlay (NVO3) networks. The architecture is given at a high-level, showing the major components of an overall system.  An important goal is to divide the space into individual smaller components that can be implemented independently and with clear interfaces and interactions with other components.  It should be possible to build and implement individual components in isolation and have them work with other components with no changes to other components.  That way implementers have flexibility in implementing individual components and can optimize and innovate within their respective components without requiring changes to other components.</t></abstract>
