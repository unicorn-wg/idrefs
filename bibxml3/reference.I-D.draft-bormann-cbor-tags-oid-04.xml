<abstract><t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation.  Useful tags and techniques have emerged since the publication of RFC 7049; the present document makes use of CBOR's built-in major types to define and refine several useful constructs, without changing the wire protocol.  This document adds object identifiers (OIDs) to CBOR with CBOR tags &lt;&lt;O>> and &lt;&lt;R>> [values TBD].  It is intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the CBOR tags so defined.  Useful techniques for enumerations and sets are presented (without new tags).  As the documentation for MIME entities (tag 36) and regular expressions (tag 35) RFC 7049 left much out, this document provides more comprehensive specifications.</t></abstract>
