<abstract><t>Layer 4 loadbalancers are widely used in the deployment of large- scale web services.  A large number of servers accept incoming connections from clients, while multiple loadbalancers make sure that traffic is spread evenly across the servers.  Due to its use of multiple subflows, Multipath TCP poses several issues to the design of a scalable layer 4 loadbalancer that supports it.  This document presents two ways in which MPTCP connections can be loadbalanced across a large pool of servers.  Both approaches entail using a slightly modified server stack and work well with unmodified MPTCP clients.</t></abstract>
