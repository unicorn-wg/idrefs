<abstract><t>This document describes the applicability of IPv6 over constrained node networks (6lo) and use cases.  It describes the practical deployment scenarios of 6lo technologies with the consideration of 6lo link layer technologies and identifies the requirements.  In addition to IEEE 802.15.4, various link layer technologies such as ITU-T G.9959 (Z-Wave), BLE, DECT-ULE, MS/TP, NFC, LTE MTC, and IEEE 802.15.4e(6tisch) are widely used at constrained node networks for typical services.  Based on these link layer technologies, IPv6 over networks of resource-constrained nodes has various and practical use cases.  To efficiently implement typical services, the applicability and consideration of several design spaces are described.</t></abstract>
