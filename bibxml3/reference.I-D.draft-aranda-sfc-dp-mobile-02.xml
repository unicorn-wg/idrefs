<abstract><t>The evolution of the network towards 5G implies a challenge for the infrastructure.  The targeted services and the full deployment of virtualization in all segments of the network will be possible and necessary to provide some traffic-specific services near the next generation base stations where the radio is processed.  Thus, service function chains that currently reside in the infrastructure of the Network operator (like, e.g. the Expeded Packet Gateway(EPG)) will be extended to the radio access network (RAN).  In this draft we provide a non-exhaustive but representative list of service functions in 4G and 5G networks, and explore different scenarios for service-aware orchestration.  We base on the problem statement [RFC7498] and architecture framework [RFC7665]  of the SFC working group, as well on the existing mobile networks use cases [I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility]  and the requirement gathering process of the ITU-R IMT 2020 [1] and different initiatives in Europe [2], Korea [3] and China [4] to anticipate network elements that will be needed in 5G networks.  We then explore service-aware orchestration scenarios identifying where different network functions can be deployed in a fully virtualised future network, where both the core and the edge provide advanced virtualisation capabilities.</t></abstract>
