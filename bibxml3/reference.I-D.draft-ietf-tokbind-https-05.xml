<abstract><t>This document describes a collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP servers to cryptographically bind authentication tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens) to TLS [RFC5246] connections.  We describe both _first-party_ and _federated_ scenarios.  In a first-party scenario, an HTTP server is able to cryptographically bind the security tokens it issues to a client, and which the client subsequently returns to the server, to the TLS connection between the client and server.  Such bound security tokens are protected from misuse since the server can generally detect if they are replayed inappropriately, e.g., over other TLS connections.  Federated token bindings, on the other hand, allow servers to cryptographically bind security tokens to a TLS connection that the client has with a _different_ server than the one issuing the token.  This Internet-Draft is a companion document to The Token Binding Protocol [I-D.ietf-tokbind-protocol]</t></abstract>
