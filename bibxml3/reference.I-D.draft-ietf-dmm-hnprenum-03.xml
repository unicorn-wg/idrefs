<abstract><t>In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial attachment and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the HNP. During the movement of the MN, the HNP is remained unchanged to keep ongoing communications associated with the HoA.  However, the current PMIPv6 specification does not specify related operations when an HNP renumbering is happened.  In this document, a solution to support the HNP renumbering is proposed, as an update of the PMIPv6 specification.</t></abstract>
