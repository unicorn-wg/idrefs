<abstract><t>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a global authorization infrastructure that allows the holder of Internet Number Resources (INRs) to make verifiable statements about those resources.  Network operators, e.g., Internet Service Providers (ISPs), can use the RPKI to validate BGP route origination assertions.  In the future, ISPs also will be able to use the RPKI to validate the path of a BGP route.  However, ISPs may want to establish a local view of the RPKI to control its own network while making use of RPKI data.  The mechanisms described in this document provide a simple way to enable INR holders to establish a local, customized view of the RPKI, overriding global RPKI repository data as needed.</t></abstract>
