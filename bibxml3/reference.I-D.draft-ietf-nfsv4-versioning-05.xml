<abstract><t>This document describes the management of versioning within the NFSv4 family of protocols.  It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition of optional features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in features already published as Proposed Standards.  The rules relating to the construction of minor versions and the interaction of minor version implementations that appear in this document supersede the minor versioning rules in RFC5661.</t></abstract>
