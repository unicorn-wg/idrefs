<abstract><t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency.  Techniques used include: 1) reserving data plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the relay nodes (bridges or routers) along the path of the flow; 2) providing fixed paths for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network topology; and 3) sequentializing, replicating, tracing and eliminating duplicate packets at various points to ensure the availability of at least one path.  The capabilities can be managed by configuration, or by manual or automatic network management.</t></abstract>
