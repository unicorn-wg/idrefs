<abstract><t>Traditional finite-field-based Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange during the TLS handshake suffers from a number of security, interoperability, and efficiency shortcomings.  These shortcomings arise from lack of clarity about which DH group parameters TLS servers should offer and clients should accept.  This document offers a solution to these shortcomings for compatible peers by using a section of the TLS "EC Named Curve Registry" to establish common finite-field DH parameters with known structure and a mechanism for peers to negotiate support for these groups.  This draft updates TLS versions 1.0 [RFC2246], 1.1 [RFC4346], and 1.2 [RFC5246], as well as the TLS ECC extensions [RFC4492].</t></abstract>
