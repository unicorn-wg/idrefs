<abstract><t>Currently, most multimedia applications utilize a combination of real-time transport protocol (RTP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). Application programs at the source end format payload data into RTP packets using RTP specifications and dispatch them using unreliable UDP along a single path. Multipath transport is an important way to improve the efficiency of data delivery. In order to apply the framework of multipath transport system based on application-level relay (MPTS-AR) to RTP-based multimedia applications, this document defines a multipath real-time transport protocol based on application-level relay (MPRTP-AR), which is a concrete application-specific multipath transport protocol (MPTP). Packet formats and packet types of MPRTP-AR follow the common rules specified in MPTP profile. Based on MPRTP-AR, RTP-based multimedia applications can make full use of the advantages brought by MPTS-AR.</t></abstract>
