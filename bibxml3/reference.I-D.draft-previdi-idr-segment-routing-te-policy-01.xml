<abstract><t>This document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order to advertise a Segment Routing Traffic Engineering Policy (SR TE Policy).  An SR TE Policy is a set of explicit paths represented by one or more segment lists.  The SR TE Policy is advertised along with the Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute for which this document also defines new sub-TLVs.  An SR TE policy is advertised with the information that will be used by the node receiving the advertisement in order to instantiate the policy in its forwarding table and to steer traffic according to the policy.</t></abstract>
