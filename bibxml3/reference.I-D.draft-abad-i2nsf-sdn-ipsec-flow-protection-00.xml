<abstract><t>This document describes the use case of providing IPsec-based flow protection by means of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller and raises the requirements to support this service.  It considers two main scenarios: (i) gateway-to-gateway and (ii) host-to-gateway (Road Warrior).  For the gateway-to-gateway scenario, this document describes a mechanism to support the distribution of IPsec information to flow-based Network Security Functions (NSFs) that implements IPsec to protect data traffic.  between network resources to protect data traffic with IPsec and IKE, in intra and inter-SDN cases.  The host-to-gateway case defines a mechanism to distribute IPsec information to the NSF to protect data with IPsec between an end user's device (host) and a gateway.</t></abstract>
