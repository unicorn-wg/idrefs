The document defines how to describe the SCTPoDTLS association used to realize the CLUE data channel using the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and defines usage of SDP-based "SCTP over DTLS" data channel negotiation mechanism for establishing a CLUE data channel.  Details and procedures associated with the CLUE protocol, and the SDP Offer/Answer procedures for negotiating usage of a CLUE data channel, are outside the scope of this document.</t></abstract>
