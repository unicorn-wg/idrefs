<abstract><t>The "alert" namespace of uniform resource names (URNs) can be used in the Alert-Info header field of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) requests and responses to inform a VoIP telephone (user agent) of the characteristics of the call that the user agent has originated or terminated.  Based on the URNs in the Alert-Info header field, the user agent must select an the best available signal to present to its user to indicate the characteristics of the call.  This document describes a method by which a user agent's designer can, based on the user agent's signals and their meanings, constructing a finite state machine (FSM) to process the URNs to select a signal in a way that obeys the restrictions given in the definition of the "alert" URN namespace.  In many situations, the resulting FSM is simpler and faster than the previously described selection algorithm.</t></abstract>
