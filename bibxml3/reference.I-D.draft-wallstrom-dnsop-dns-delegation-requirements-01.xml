<abstract><t>This document outlines a set of requirements on a well-behaved DNS delegation of a domain name.  A large number of tools have been developed to test DNS delegations, but each tool uses a different set of requirements for what is a correct setup for a delegated domain name.  However, there are few requirements on how to set up DNS in order to just make the delegation work.  In order to have a well- behaved delegation that is robust to failures and also makes DNS resolvers behave consistently, there are a large number of things to consider.  Based on this document, it should be possible to set up a fully functional DNS delegation for a domain name, but also to create a set of test specifications for how to test a DNS delegation.</t></abstract>
