<abstract><t>This document specifies an update of TLS 1.2 for long-term support, one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with the security holes and bugs fixed.  This represents a stable, known-good version that can be deployed to systems that can't roll out a new set of patches every month or two when the next attack on TLS is published.</t></abstract>
