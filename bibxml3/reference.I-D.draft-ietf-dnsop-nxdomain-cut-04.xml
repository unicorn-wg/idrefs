<abstract><t>This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a response with response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain name which is thus denied AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.  REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: this document should be discussed in the IETF DNSOP (DNS Operations) group, through its mailing list.  The source of the document, as well as a list of open issues, is currently kept at Github [1].  This documents clarifies RFC 1034 and modifies RFC 2308 a bit so it updates both of them.</t></abstract>
