<abstract><t>While there has been some work in the area of firewalls, concrete requirements for IPv6 firewalls have never been specified in the RFC series.  The more limited experience with the IPv6 protocols and the more reduced number of firewalls that support IPv6 has made it rather difficult to infer what are reasonable features to expect in an IPv6 firewall.  This has typically been a problem for network operators, who typically have to produce a "Request for Proposal" from scratch that describes such features.  This document specifies a set of requirements for IPv6 firewalls, in order to establish some common- ground in terms of what features can be expected in them.</t></abstract>
