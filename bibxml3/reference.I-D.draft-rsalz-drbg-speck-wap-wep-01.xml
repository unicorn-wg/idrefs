<abstract><t>Cryptography is becoming more important to the IETF and its protocols, and more IETF protocols are using, or looking at, cryptography to increase privacy on the Internet [RFC7258].  This document specifies a proposed best practice for any mechanism (or data format) that uses cryptography; namely, that RFCs cannot specify an algorithm as mandatory-to-implement (MTI) unless that algorithm has had reasonable public review.  This document also "sketches out" a rough definition around what such a review would look like.</t></abstract>
