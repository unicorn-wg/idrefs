<abstract><t>This document has been written to capture the design rationale for the individual draft-00 version of BGPSEC protocol specification (I- D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00).  It lists the decisions that were made in favor of or against each design choice, and presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.  A similar document can be published in the future as the BGPSEC design discussions make further progress and additional design considerations are discussed and finalized.</t></abstract>
