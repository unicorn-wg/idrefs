<abstract><t>An architecture is described for content distribution using a secondary server that might be operated with reduced privileges. This architecture allows a primary server to delegate the responsibility for delivery of the payload of an HTTP response to a secondary server.  The secondary server is unable to modify this content.  The content is encrypted, which in some cases will prevent the secondary server from learning about the content.</t></abstract>
