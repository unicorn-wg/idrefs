<abstract><t>The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such as Mobile IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current and future networks, due to the expected large number of mobile users and their exigent demands.  All this has triggered the need for distributed mobility management alternatives, that alleviate operators' concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient network deployments.  This draft describes a possible way of achieving a distributed mobility behavior with Client Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and the use of Cryptographic Generated Addresses.</t></abstract>
