<abstract><t>For concreteness, because the universal character set is not yet universal, because an undocumented and unlabeled coded character set hampers information interchange, a 12-bit coded character set has been created that encodes the graphemes of the SignWriting script as described in the open standard of the International SignWriting Alphabet 2010.  The x-ISWA-2010 coded character set is defined with hexadecimal characters and described with Unicode characters, either proposed characters on plane 1 or interchange characters on plane 15.  This memo defines a standard coded character set for the Internet community.  It is published for reference, examination, implementation, and evaluation.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</t></abstract>
