<abstract><t>Several technologies such as traffic engineering, service function chaining, or policy based routing, are used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined path.  This document defines mechanisms to securely prove that traffic transited the defined path.  The mechanisms allow to securely verify whether all packets traversed all those nodes of a given path that they are supposed to visit.</t></abstract>
