<abstract><t>This document presents a model of Security Capabilities.  Security Capabilities are intended to describe the potentiality that Network Security Functions (NSFs) have for security policy enforcement purposes.  Therefore, Security Capabilities are represented as abstract functionalities that a NSF owns in terms of enforcement actions, conditions that can apply in order to determine to which packet or traffic enforce the actions, and other mechanisms that NSF use to determine the actions to enforce.  The proposed capability model defines without ambiguities the operations a function can do in term of security policy enforcement.</t></abstract>
