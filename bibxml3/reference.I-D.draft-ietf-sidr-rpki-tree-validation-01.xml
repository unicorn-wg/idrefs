<abstract><t>This document describes the approach to validate the content of the RPKI certificate tree, as used by the RIPE NCC RPKI Validator.  This approach is independent of a particular object retrieval mechanism. This allows it to be used with repositories available over the rsync protocol, the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol, and repositories that use a mix of both.  This algorithm does not rely on content of repository directories, but uses the Authority Key Identifier (AKI) field of a manifest and a certificate revocation list (CRL) objects to discover manifest and CRL objects issued by a particular Certificate Authority (CA).  It further uses the hashes of manifest entries to discover other objects issued by the CA.</t></abstract>
