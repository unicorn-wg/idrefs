<abstract><t>This document updates RFC5575 which defines a Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP NLRI) encoding format that can be used to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This allows the routing system to propagate information regarding more specific components of the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.  This draft specifices IPv4 traffic flow specificaitnos.  Other drafst specify , IPv6), MPLS addresses, L2VPN addresses, and NV03 encapsulation of IP addresses.  The information is carried via the BGP, thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience, and administrative processes such as inter- provider peering agreements.  There are applications of that encoding format: 1) automation of inter-domain coordination of traffic filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate (distributed) denial-of-service attacks; 2) enable traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service, and 3) aid centralized control of traffic in a SDN or NFV context.  Some of deployments of these three applications can be handled by the strict ordering of the BGP NLRI traffic flow filters, and the strict actions encoded in the Extended Community Flow Specification actions.  This defines the first two applications.  This document provides the definition of a BGP NLRI which carries traffic flow specification filters, and Extended Community values which encode the actions a routing system can take if a packet matches the traffic flow filters.  The specification requires that the BGP Flow Specification traffic filters follows a string ordering, and that the BGP Flow Specification Extended Communities actions are processed in a defined order.</t></abstract>
