<abstract><t>In conventional enterprise data centers, there are at least two networks: Ethernet that allows users to access their applications on servers, optical networks which built on Fiber Channel, that enables those servers to access big data on storage network.  Because of their specialized hardware, they have vastly different management tools and require completely different skill sets to build and maintain.  The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed to provide network related information to client applications.  It has developed a lot in Ethernet, and now we consider to build a central control in a basic Ethernet and Optical converged networks.  Follow the concept of ALTO implementing in Ethernet networks, an ALTO server can get the necessary information from underlining Ethernet and Optical converged networks.  After abstracting the network information, ALTO server can achieve a central resource allocation and organize them into a standard format so as to provide useful information to ALTO clients.  This document designs a basic way of applying ALTO in converged networks.</t></abstract>
