<abstract><t>RFC7623 defines how Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB) can be combined with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to deploy ELAN services in very large MPLS networks. RFC7623 also describes how Single-Active Multi-homing and per-ISID Load-Balancing can be provided to access devices and aggregation networks. In order to speed up the network convergence in case of failures on Single-Active Multi-Homed Ethernet Segments, RFC7623 defines a CMAC-Flush mechanism that works for different Ethernet Segment BMAC address allocation models. This document complements those CMAC-Flush procedures for cases in which no PBB- EVPN Ethernet Segments are defined (ESI 0) and an ISID-based CMAC- Flush granularity is desired.</t></abstract>
