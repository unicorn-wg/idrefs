<abstract><t>Ipv6 Multihoming for Host could be implemented using Ipv6-to-Ipv6 Network prefix translation (NPTv6), however NPTv6 not ideal as this solution not achieve End-to-End transparency of connectivity. Basic issues with End host Multihoming architecture without NPTv6 are: 1. Source address selection, 2. Next hop selection and 3. DNS resolution. One other approach to solve above mention all three issues with End-to-End transparent connectivity would be using policy at End host to enforce source address and next hop selection. In this document,a solution being propose to solve all above mention three problem enhancing policy based enforcement on host directed by router using its router advertisement.This document not obsolete any of the previous work,only propose how policy on End-host can be enforce from router by mapping destination prefix with DNS via Router Advertisement.</t></abstract>
