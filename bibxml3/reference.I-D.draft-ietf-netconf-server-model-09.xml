<abstract><t>This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model and a RESTCONF server configuration data model.  These data models enable configuration of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves, including which transports are supported, what ports the servers listen on, call-home parameters, client authentication, and related parameters.
