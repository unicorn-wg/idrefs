<abstract><t>Software Defined Networking proposes the separation of the control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical centralization on a control entity.  Most of the network intelligence is moved to this functional entity.  Typically, such entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion.  The relocation of the control functions from a number of distributed network nodes to a logical central entity conceptually places together a number of control capabilities with different purposes.  As a consequence, the existing solutions do not provide a clear separation between transport control and services that relies upon transport capabilities.  This document describes a proposal named Cooperating Layered Architecture for SDN.  The idea behind that is to differentiate the control functions associated to transport from those related to services, in such a way that they can be provided and maintained independently, and can follow their own evolution path.</t></abstract>
