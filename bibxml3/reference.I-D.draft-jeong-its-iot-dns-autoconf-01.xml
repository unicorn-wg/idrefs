<abstract><t>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the global (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle units.  By this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's model information in wired and wireless target networks (e.g., vehicle, road network, home, office, shopping mall, and smart grid).  This DNS name lets IoT users (e.g., drivers, passengers, home residents, and customers) in the Internet (or local network) easily identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it in the target network.</t></abstract>
