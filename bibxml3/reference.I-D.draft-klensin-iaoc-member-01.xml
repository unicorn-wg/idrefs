<abstract><t>The original specification of the membership of the IAOC included the IETF and IAB Chairs as voting members.  While probably desirable initially, this has turned out to have unfortunate side effects. This document discusses those side effects and replaces those specific individuals with liaisons from the IAB and IESG.</t></abstract>
