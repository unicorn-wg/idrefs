<abstract><t>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages.  When establishing interactive communication ("calls") there needs to be a way to negotiate (communicate and match) the caller's language and media needs with the capabilities of the called party.  This is especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be handled by a call taker capable of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling a company call center).  This document describes the need and a solution using new SDP stream attributes.</t></abstract>
