<abstract><t>Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates of the Ethernet PHY(s).  OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was the first step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY rates.  OIF has recently approved another implementation agreement [OIFFLEXE1] which allows complete decoupling of the MAC data rates and the Ethernet PHY(s) that support them.  This includes support for (a) MAC rates which are greater than the rate of a single PHY (satisfied by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC rates which are less than the rate of a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple FlexE client signals carried over a single PHY, or over a collection of bonded PHY(s).  This draft catalogs the usecases that are encountered when these Flexible rate Ethernet client signals are transported over OTN networks.</t></abstract>
