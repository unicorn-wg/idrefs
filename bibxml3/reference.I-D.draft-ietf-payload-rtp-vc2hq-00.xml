<abstract><t>This memo describes an RTP Payload format for the High Quality (HQ) profile of SMPTE Standard ST 2042-1 known as VC-2.  This document describes the transport of HQ Profile VC-2 in RTP packets and has applications for low-complexity, high-bandwidth streaming of both lossless and lossy compressed video.  The HQ profile of VC-2 is intended for low latency video compression (with latency potentially on the order of lines of video) at high data rates (with compression ratios on the order of 2:1 or 4:1).</t></abstract>
