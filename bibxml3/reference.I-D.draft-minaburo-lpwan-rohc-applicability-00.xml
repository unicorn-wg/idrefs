<abstract><t>This document makes a survey of the way to adapt the RoHC mechanisms to the LPWAN networks.  It aims to show that RoHC header compression is not adapted for the constrained LPWAN networks.  RoHC was defined to reduce the overhead over point-to-point connections for multimedia flows, which does not correspond to the LPWAN traffic description. RoHC is not able to reduce the use of battery and optimize the energy lifetime.  If RoHC is used it will need a big effort to be adapted, there would be some problems to preserve a good transmission and packet lost will cause a context desynchronisation which implies a transmission of a complete header.  LP-WAN's are different technologies covering different applications based on long range, low bandwidth and low power operation.</t></abstract>
