<abstract><t>This document describes some performance issues that have been observed when multicast packet transmission is attempted over IEEE 802 wireless media.  Multicast features specified for IEEE 802 wireless media related to multicast are also described, along with explanations about how these features can help ameliorate the observed performance issues.  IETF protocols that are likely to be affected by the observed performance issues are identified, and workarounds are proposed in some cases.  The performance of multicast over wireless media often can be quite different than the performance of unicast.  This draft describes the nature of the differences and the effects on representative IETF protocols.  We also describe some efforts that have been made by IEEE 802 Wireless groups to ameliorate the performance differences.</t></abstract>
