<abstract><t>Being able to trust information from sensors and to securely control actuators is essential in a world of connected and networking things interacting with the physical world.  In this memo we show that just using COAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCOAP is not enough.  We describe several serious attacks any on-path attacker can do, and discusses tougher requirements and mechanisms to mitigate the attacks.  While this document is focused on actuators, one of the attacks applies equally well to sensors using DTLS.</t></abstract>
