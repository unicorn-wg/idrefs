<abstract><t>The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to be ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a limitation for deploying current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized, e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6. For this reason it has been waved a need for distributed and dynamic mobility management approaches, with the objective of reducing operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient architecture.  This draft describes multiple solutions for network-based distributed mobility management inspired by the well known Proxy Mobile IPv6.</t></abstract>
