<abstract><t>This specification defines a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'.  The extension can be used with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media, referred to as bundled media, specified by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines).  To assist endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to request that specific media is only used if bundled.  The specification also updates RFC 3264, to allow usage of zero port values without meaning that media is rejcted.  There are multiple ways to correlate the bundled RTP packets with the appropriate media descriptions.  This specification defines a new Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header extension that provides an additional way to do this correlation by using them to carry a value that associates the RTP/ RTCP packets with a specific media description.</t></abstract>
