<abstract><t>This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distributor to facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Distributor. The protocol is designed to ensure that the keying material used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the media distributor, while the keying material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the media distributor.</t></abstract>
