<abstract><t>This document addresses the issue of provisioning end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) for multimedia services over heterogeneous networks and introduces a parametric model by using network calculus theory for QoS class mapping between different QoS domains.  Then a QoS Mapping Scheme based on Flow Aggregation (QMS-FAG) is proposed in this document to mitigate the information loss problem due to mapping between QoS domains with different granularity of QoS class and to provide efficient network resources utilization by considering user's Quality of Experience (QoE).  In QMS-FAG, the QoS requirements of service flows are indicated by a unique FAG identifier which is described in a service flow map of QoS parameters.  With FAG identifier and mapping executors sitting at the border of different QoS domains, QMS-FAG allows smooth QoS class mapping between networks with different granularity of QoS class.  Both numerical analysis and simulation studies are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</t></abstract>
